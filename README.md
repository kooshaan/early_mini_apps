📌 Salaam, It's @kooshaan; Just started using github for my personal projects presentation, and obviously I'm learning kotlin programming currently.

Always reachable by my personal number, and by @malekmohammadkooshan in social medias.
👨‍💻 Anyway, not so excited about starting to work with git, hope this could give me a hand improving my skills and maybe help another one learn something Allah Willing..🕯️
